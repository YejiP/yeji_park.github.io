<br>The numbers 0 to 9 were tested to see the model can recognize the real handwritting.
<br>It seems like it cannot recognize well when it comes to number 6 and 8. The reason might be its poor weights about judging number 6 and 8, due to overfitting. (The implementation is lack of regularization method.)
<br>The accuracy used in this demo was around 0.8.
<br>The weights were driven by the model that i made, not from keras.
<br>If the weights were driven from the keras, then it might have shown better performance, however, the purpose of demo was not showing the performance of keras, but the algorithm i implemented and trained.
<br>It can be improved by adding regularization. <br>
