# **Components**

```
Motherboard, CPU, Memory, Power supply, GPU, Storage
```

**Motherboard** : The follow a standard layout but can have different configurations depending on the use case. 

Q) So if I wanted to build a gaming or AI specific computer, would I need to choose a different motherboard for each purpose?

**CPU** : Central Processing Unit, this is where the numbers get crunched and is what is core to a computer, it is socketed directly to the motherboard. 

**Memory** : RAM (Random Access Memory, not REM, that is Rapid Eye Movement.)

**PSU** : Power Supply, it converts AC power to DC power to run the components of your computer.

**GPU** : Graphics Processing Unit, it handles the processing of visual aspects of a game or works as high core processing for AI

**Storage** : The two main types are HDD (Hard Disk Drive - mechanical) and SSD (Solid State Drive - no moving parts) and can vary in capacity and form factor.

**I/O Devices** : Such as a mouse, keyboard, monitor and so on, the devices used to interface with the computer.

# Before getting started, 

Connect yourself to a grounded power supply part using an anti-static strap. It will prevent **ESD sensitive components**  from getting damaged.

** ESD : Electrostatic-Sensitive Device

Most computer components only require a size 2 Philips-head screwdriver to install.

1. Place the CPU in the CPU socket making sure it's in the correct orientation.

2. Install the two RAM modules and note the notch for correct installation, after this install the M.2 SDD and screw it down.

3. When installing the cooler check to see if thermal compound has been pre-applied, if not apply only a pea sized amount on the center of the CPU, the pressure from installing the cooler will spread the compound. If you have an overclockable CPU a cooler that is higher rated would give better results when doing so.

4. The motherboard has a CPU fan pin which the cooler fan needs to be connected to, some computers will not boot if no CPU fan is detected.

5. The power supply should come with all the power cables necessary to run the computer. 

6. If you plan to install a lot of fans you would need to have a fan splitter and to connect SATA power to the splitter.

7. Install the motherboard into the case. but before this, make sure to put the IO shield first into the case.

8. Once the motherboard has been screwed in securely you can start to plug in all the necessary power cables.

9. Take note of which cables are used for which devices.

10. Insert SATA SSD into the case, depending on the mount it should slot in or would need to be screwed in. Then connect the SATA data cable to motherboard and SSD.

11. Install the power supply and connect all the needed power supply cables to the motherboard.

12. PCI express power connector -> connects the graphics card and power supply

13. SATA power (SSD, hard drive, integrated RGB controller)

14. Put the graphics card in the PCI slot on the motherboard. Note the graphics card has it's own IO shield so remove the IO plates corresponding to where the graphics card will be.

** PCI express :  an interface that connects internal expansion cards such as graphics cards, sound cards, Ethernet and Wi-Fi adapters to the **motherboard**. [source](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/pci-express-pcie/)

** Overclocking : Overclocking is the action of increasing a componentâ€™s clock rate, **running it at a higher speed than it was designed to run**. This is usually applies to the CPU or GPU, but other components can also be overclocked.
