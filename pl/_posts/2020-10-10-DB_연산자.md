# Oracle DB 연산자

## 산술연산자





## 비교연산자

**부등호 :** =, != , \>, <, \>=, <=



## 논리 연산자

**AND**

```SQL
SELECT FIRST_NAME, JOB_ID,SALARY FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE department_id <= 80 AND department_id >=50;
```

```SQL
SELECT FIRST_NAME, JOB_ID,SALARY FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE department_id BETWEEN 50 AND 80
```

**OR**

```SQL
SELECT FIRST_NAME, JOB_ID,SALARY FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE department_id =80 OR department_id =50;
```

**IN**

```mssql
SELECT FIRST_NAME, JOB_ID,SALARY FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE department_id IN (50,80);
```

위 OR과 같은 의미다! 깔끔함.

**NOT**

```SQL
SELECT FIRST_NAME, JOB_ID,SALARY FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE NOT (department_id =80);
```

**LIKE %**

```sql
SELECT FIRST_NAME, JOB_ID,SALARY FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE FIRST_NAME LIKE '%n';
```

%는 0글자 이상 여러글자

```sql
SELECT FIRST_NAME, JOB_ID,SALARY FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE FIRST_NAME LIKE '__n';
```

_는 한글자

**IS NULL / IS NOT NULL**

```SQL
SELECT FIRST_NAME, JOB_ID,SALARY FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE commision_pct IS NULL;

SELECT FIRST_NAME,SALARY, SALARY*(1+ commission_pct) as "총합" FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE commission_pct IS NOT NULL;

```



## 집합 연산자

**UNION , MINUS , INTERSECT**

SELECT 로 질의된 결과물을 하나의 집합으로

```SQL
SELECT FIRST_NAME, SALARY, DEPARTMENT_ID
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID =80 --세미콜론 없앰

UNION

SELECT FIRST_NAME, SALARY, DEPARTMENT_ID
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID =50;
```

**UNION ALL** 쓰면 중복 데이터가 생략되지 않고 다 나온다.

```sql
SELECT FIRST_NAME, SALARY, DEPARTMENT_ID
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID =80 --세미콜론 없앰

UNION ALL

SELECT FIRST_NAME, SALARY, DEPARTMENT_ID
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID =50;
```



**MINUS :** 차집합. 중복되는 자료들을 빼고 보여준다.

```SQL
SELECT FIRST_NAME, SALARY, DEPARTMENT_ID
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID =80 --세미콜론 없앰

MINUS

SELECT FIRST_NAME, SALARY, DEPARTMENT_ID
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID =50;
```

**INTERSECT :** 중복자료들만 보여준다.

```SQL
SELECT FIRST_NAME, SALARY, DEPARTMENT_ID
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID =80 --세미콜론 없앰

INTERSECT

SELECT FIRST_NAME, SALARY, DEPARTMENT_ID
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID =50;
```
